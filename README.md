## Run:

## Questions To Answer: 
This is your chance to talk about the prompt! Please provide these answers on your README. 
- Please share your screen resolution, OS, browser version (best if you're using latest) you used to test in so we can look at it in: 

⋅⋅⋅Screen resolution: (2560 x 1600), OS: 10.13.6, Browser: Chrome Version 78.0.3904.108

- What part of the design did you get stuck on? What took the most time? Similarly, what was the easiest part? 

...It took me a while to decide whether or not I wanted to go with Material-UI or Bootstrap. It had also been a while (~over a year) since I've built an app using Node.js and React, so I had to take some extra time to review my old projects to get back into the swing of things. Once I was able to get acclimated with Material-UI, I found it easy to import and style the components. It was very helpful that majority of the components for this project were in Material-UI. 

- What part of the design didn't make sense? Did you change anything?

...I found myself experimenting with different Components and styling methods. Using Flex/Grid directly in Material-UI was a little tricky at first. For example, my Nav/Appbar spacing is not spaced the way I would have wanted it to be. Additionally, the side bar was tough to style - that was the first component I built, so I was still trying to get into the swing of things. 

- If you had more time, what would you have liked to implement? 

...I would have organized the components into separate folders and done a lot better with the organizational structure overall. I also would've liked to have a separate file for the theme/styles for each component as well. Instead, I included the themes/styles in each component file rather than important it separately. 

- What did you have to research or lookup while working on this? 

...As I mentioned, it had been a little over a year since I had used React.js – which made this exercise very helpful as a refresher. I was having a lot of trouble styling the components, so I spent more time researching how to adjust the styles in the way I wanted to.
